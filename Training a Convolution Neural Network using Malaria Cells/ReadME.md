Training an CNN using Malara Cells.

It uses the tensorflow with keras framework using various libraries in Python. The code is implemented in Jupyter Note book. 

This files includes a Research Report, Jupter Notebook(using Google Colab)

More Info can be found on the research Paper.

Download the zip file, upload the zip file to google drive. Change the Google Colab runtime to GPU or else CNN model would take longer time to validate accuary of image classficaiton of parasitized and uninfected cells. 

In the code, the first cell in the ipynb will mount the gdrive(google drive) on to your content file. 

The second cell will unzip the content contians 2 class of subdirectory with images of uninfected and parasitized malaria cells.
